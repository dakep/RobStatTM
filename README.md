# RobStatTM

This repository contains the companion package to the upcoming 2nd edition of
the book [Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods](https://wwww.wiley.com/go/maronna/robust), by Ricardo Maronna, Doug Martin, Victor Yohai and Matias Salibian-Barrera.

* To install it directly from GitHub, install the `devtools` package and then use
```
devtools::install_github("msalibian/RobStatTM")
```
* The scripts reproducing the examples and figures in the book can be found [here](inst/scripts).

* The package has been submitted to CRAN and we expect it to be available there soon.
